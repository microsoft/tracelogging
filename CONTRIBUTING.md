# Release

This repository uses the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) model.

This means that any commit which reaches master is considered 'released' since projects which depend on this library as a submodule may choose to update at any time. The master branch is policy-protected and does not accept direct pushes.

To get code into master:

1. Create a topic branch from master.
2. Commit code to your topic.
3. Open a Pull Request into master.
4. Once approved, squash your branch into master.

Pull requests must use squash commit to keep master history clean.

Pull Requests must be approved by a member of the [Device Health Services Team](https://github.com/orgs/microsoft/teams/device-health-services-team).

Pull Requests must be up to date with master and must pass the CI status check.
