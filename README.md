# TraceLogging

TraceLogging is a set of technologies for emitting structured events. It is
primarily used with Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). Some parts of
TraceLogging are also available on other operating systems.

## TraceLogging for ETW (Windows)

[TraceLogging for ETW](etw/README.md) provides helpers for using TraceLogging with
[Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/etw/about-event-tracing).

## TraceLogging for LTTng (Linux)

[TraceLogging for LTTng](LTTng/README.md) provides an LTTng Helpers library and a
TraceLoggingProvider.h header. This allows C/C++ developers to use the same
TraceLoggingProvider syntax to generate events for both ETW and [LTTng](https://lttng.org/).

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the
Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at <[secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com)>.
You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via
